			<div class="about">

				<p>I most recently completed the User Interface Design Program at the Iron Yard Academy, Columbia. During this 12 week intensive program, I explored the entire production process for building responsive interfaces and designing for multiple devices including discovery and ideation, the design process (thumbnails, wireframes, Photoshop mockups) HTML, CSS & SASS, basic Javascipt & JQuery, Github, the Git workflow, asset management, and using programs such as InVision to test prototypes.</p>

				<p>Prior to The Iron Yard, art and design has always been in the fabric of what I do. Born in Nashville, Tennessee and raised in Miami, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina, I attended the University of North Carolina, School of the Arts in Winston-Salem for high school, and then went on to study at Tufts University and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where I earned a BFA in Studio Arts in 2006.</p> 

				<p>After graduating, I spent 3 years working in commercial post-production in Boston and then unexpectedly landed in Los Angeles working in the film industry, where I found my niche working in the art department for various types of productions. I stayed out west for two years and then landed back in Charlotte in 2011, where I joined Apple Retail.</p>

				<p>I'm looking to connect with other professionals designing for the web. I'd like to integrate my background in art and production with the User Interface Design and Development Skills I've learned from the Iron Yard.</p>
