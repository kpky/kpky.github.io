			<div class="about">

				<p>I have a passion for designing responsive interfaces that are clean, intuitive, and smart. I enjoy the challenge of designing interfaces that function seamlessly and look incredible on every type of device and screen size. </p>

				<p>Art and design have always been woven in the fabric of what I do. My art education started in high school at the prestigious North Carolina School of the Arts Visual Arts/Design program and then continued at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and Tufts University where I earned my BFA in Studio Arts in 2006.</p>

				<p>I recently completed a User Interface Design program during which I explored the entire responsive design process from discovery and ideation, UX research, wireframes and mockups, to the development with HTML5 and CSS3. Besides designing and coding, I also utilyze prototyping tools to bring my designs to life.</p>
	
				<p>I have 10 years of experience in fast paced creative environments in Boston, Los Angeles, and Charlotte. I have a solid understanding of design principles and typography, an eye for detail, and a love of coding. I am seeking a full time position with a company or agency that will allow me to grow and learn in the areas of User Interface Design and Responsive Design.</p>
